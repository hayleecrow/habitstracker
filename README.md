### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **React** - Provides login and changes how the streak looks when a goal is completed.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
    - Retriving and storing habits and streak counts
    - Register, login, logout users, and securly store their info
    - Allow user to choose an emoji to go along with their habit using EmojiHub service (https://github.com/cheatsnake/emojihub).
- **DB/Login** - Store authentication information, users, habits, and streaks in database.
- **WebSocket** - Broadcasts a user's streak and habits to their connected friends.
