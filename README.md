# Habits Tracker

[My Notes](notes.md)

- Good commit messages include the what and why and often use consistant naming conventions
- 

> [!NOTE]
> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

### Elevator pitch

Are their multiple habits you are wanting to build? Have you ever wished there was an easy way to keep track of your progress? Habit Tracker allows you to easily keep track of all your daily goals and track your progress. You can also see your friends goals and encourage them in their progress. Work together to build the habits you've always wanted!

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Basic structure and organization. Three HTML pages: one for login, one for managing the user's habits, and one for viewing and interacting with friends' habits.
- **CSS** - Styling so it looks appealing and good on different screens, and animating the streak fire.
- **React** - Provides login and changes how the streak looks when a goal is completed.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
    - Retriving and storing habits and streak counts
    - Register, login, logout users, and securly store their info
    - Allow user to choose an emoji to go along with their habit using EmojiHub service (https://github.com/cheatsnake/emojihub).
- **DB/Login** - Store authentication information, users, habits, and streaks in database.
- **WebSocket** - Broadcasts a user's streak and habits to their connected friends.
